        <P>
            There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but
            the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour,
            or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are
            going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't 
            anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum 
            generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, 
            making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary
            of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures,
            to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is 
            therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.

        The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below
        for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum
        et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied 
        by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham
